# CPU Scheduling Algorithms ðŸš€

This repository contains implementations of various CPU scheduling algorithms. The goal is to provide a clear and concise understanding of how different scheduling policies work and their impact on process execution.

## Implemented Algorithms
Currently, the repository includes the following algorithm:

First-Come, First-Served (FCFS): This is the simplest scheduling algorithm that executes processes in the order they arrive.
Shortest Job First(SJF)

## Assumptions
unless explicitly stated otherwise, the arrival times of processes are assumed to start from 0 and increment sequentially (0, 1, 2, 3, ...).
